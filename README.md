# Qualitative Analysis with Annotation Management
I lead a team of undergraduate research assistants in the annotation of a large corpus of data. 
This included collaborating on a 'codebook' that served as a term of reference for the team. I developed a protocol to test our annotation application that involved mathematical measurement of agreement according to standards of the research field.
